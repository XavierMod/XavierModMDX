TLDR: A list of my favourite tech youtubers
---

## General tech
*   Cold Fusion - A favorite. In-depth small video-documentaries about several tech topics. Very entertaining and useful. The guy's voice is so smooth I could listen to him for days.
*   Linus Tech Tips - I don't even think it's necessary to talk about the great Linus! Awesome guy (and his team), probably one of the most general tech YouTubers out there. Worth checking out.
*   Tech With Sean - A small youtuber yet with very interesting tech content.
*   Max Tech - Very good tech reviews. Worth checking out.
*   Marques Brownlee - A favorite. Another great guy. Great tech reviews.
*   Tech Insider - Innovation, gadgets, how-to's, gaming... awesome channel.
*   Jim Browning - An IT expert who tracks scammers around the globe and records evidence of them scamming other people. Very entertaining to watch.
*   Tom Scott - The MAIN TECH MAN! Tom Scott has been in the business for a long time and his general tech videos are amazing.

## Tech Youtubers
*   Tren Black - This guy has gained some attention lately because he's taking on the whole Silicon Valley! He researches about other "tech YouTubers" and makes a video exposing all their bullshit, which is entertaining to watch. He also experiments with more content formats that are cool.
*   Ben Awad - A very very talented developer who knows what he's talking about. His tutorials are rather impressive and not biased when giving his opinions on something.
*   Joshua Fluke - His series of corporate cringe videos are amazing, one of the most entertaining tech media I've seen on Youtube, and he also gives great advice on entrepreneurship and digital businesses. However, I hate when he does vids like "My girlfriend cheated... with my best friend (showing real text messages)". A great guy that talks realistically about the industry (though I don't agree with him all the time).
*   Traversy Media - The BEST web dev tutorials on YouTube. Traversy is the main man! He also gives great advice on all tech topics.
*   LearnCode.academy - Good basic-medium HTML/CSS/JS tutorials.
*   *   DesignCourse - Great tutorials on front end dev and UI Design explained properly by a good guy, though he's a bit cringy sometimes.
Coding Tech - Tech talks worth sharing, as simple as that!

## In-depth Dev Content
*   Google Chrome Developers - It's Google. What else can I say? Great analysis, reviews, tutorials, news...
*   GitNation React Conferences - A channel about React and React conferences, by *   GitNation. Extremely in-depth and very advanced React tutorials.
*   JSConf - JavaScript conferences from around the world.
*   Frontend Love - My favorite front end developers conference with great talks in React, Angular, Vue...
