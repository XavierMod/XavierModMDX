Tell It is a news app targeted to a younger demographic. As part of one of our 2nd-year University modules, we were told to design and prototype this project. 

# App objectives

*   To design a mobile app delivering the news to a younger demographic (ages 18-25)
*   Consider a breaking news day on the designs. 3. How the app would look like on a standard news day.

# User target

80% of the online market consumes content on a mobile. The user is digitally native and savvy, being the highest users of mobile for the longest periods of time.

# App considerations

*   News Brand, Top Stories, Video, Categories, Interactions, Social, shareability, gamification. 2. Include an article from these categories: UK, Politics, US, Science & Tech, and Ents & Arts.

# Initial Research on Millennials and Generation Z’s (M&Z).

Millennials were born between 1983 and 1994, while Gen Z’s were born from 1995 to 2002. When doing studies and research on these two types, the answers provided are often remarkably similar.
