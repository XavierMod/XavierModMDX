Pinfluencer is an influencer marketing platform that connects sustainably-minded brands with influencers in order to facilitate collaborations that have a net positive impact. During my third year of University, I joined the Pinfluencer team as a Front-End Developer / Designer, being also one of the earliest team members.

I mainly focus on front-end development while also being involved in the design team to build a user-centered visually appealing web platform using the latest front-end technologies.

Responsibilities:
∙ Writing the front-end code and building the user interface of the Pinfluencer platform (Vue.js, SASS, Bootstrap).
∙ API-driven development.
∙ Debugging code errors and troubleshooting software issues.
∙ UX/UI enhancements.
∙ Meeting with the project management team to discuss application features and design ideas.
∙ Researching similar application designs and user interface modules.
∙ Creating website and application design mockups with enhanced UI features.
∙ Updating the platform in line with user trends.
∙ Participating in UX Focus groups.

The current project's status is pre-alpha.
