Furgo is a SaaS Logistics Delivery Platform. I started as a Graphic/Motion Design Intern and then got hired as a UI designer to shape the UI of Furgo's digital products and experiences. I had the chance of working in a small startup team, with developers, business and product managers. I was partially in charge of some design decisions and translated the given user-experience journey into a user-centered app and a smooth and intuitive SaaS logistics web solution.

What did I learn?

*   How to work on a fast-paced Startup environment.
*   Create, improve and use wireframes, prototypes, style guides, user flows, and effectively communicate interaction ideas using these methods.
*   How to make design decisions based on fundamental principles.
*   Teamwork.
*   Client pitches.
