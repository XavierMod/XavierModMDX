FitSprint is a VC backed freemium Saas platform for fitness professionals. During my first year of university, I got a Mobile UI internship at FitSprint and then got hired as a UI/Product Designer. I was in charge of creating, improving and wireframing as well as building prototypes, style guides and user flows.

I also got involved in the Front-End team as a junior UI Developer, styling library components such as buttons, emails and other elements.
