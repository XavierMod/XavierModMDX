I made this burger ordering website as part of one of my first-year university modules. This assignment required me to combine the skills I developed in EE1701 Web Design and Development, EE1706 Interaction and Usability Design, and EE1707 Programming for Digital Media 2 in order to develop a responsive burger-ordering website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript which exhibits effective interaction and usability.

Please note this project is outdated, meaning that my skills have improved and now I user other more modern web technologies such as frameworks, etc. and follow industry-standard programming practices.
