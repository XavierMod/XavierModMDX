Starplan is a real-time browser-based, resources-management, trading, and war-based multiplayer game (MMO) that has been ideated following the same core concepts and elements from its predecessors, through a mobile-focused and modern interface, current gaming models and strategies, and built using the latest web technologies. 

Furthermore, Starplan is targeted to a much broader gaming audience. It will be playable on a wide array of devices, allowing users to easily access the game from anywhere anytime. Starplan follows the same ideas other previous games have followed, but its execution is drastically different, making it a reinvention of those games. Several innovative gaming features are included in Starplan, some of them being ideated taking other current mobile successful games as an inspiration and some adding a breath of fresh air to its gameplay.

I am currently developing Starplan for my final year's project and will post updates soon.
