### My career roadmap

My focus is on the front-end, though I also enjoy building back-end APIs and microservices. Due to my eagerness to understand the product, I like to get involved in the design ideation process too, building wireframes, prototypes and design iterations.

Currently, my goal is to learn as much as I can so I can slowly transition to tech leadership positions, in the hope of one day leading the technical direction of a cutting-edge sustainable company.
